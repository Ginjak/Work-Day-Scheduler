## Usage

1. [Access the Planner](https://ginjak.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/)

2. Set Planner Hours:
   Use the "Change Planner Times" button to specify the start and end hours of your day. Click "Submit" to update the planner with your chosen time range.

3. View Current Day:
   The current day is prominently displayed at the top of the planner. Ensure it matches the day you intend to plan for.

4. Time Blocks Creation:
   The planner will dynamically generate time blocks based on the specified planner hours. Each block represents a different hour within your day.

5. Enter Tasks:
   Within each time block, find a text area where you can enter your tasks or to-do items. Click on the text area for the respective hour to input your task.

6. Real-Time Styling:
   Tasks are color-coded based on their timing relative to the current time. Future tasks are green, present tasks are red, and past tasks are gray. This provides a quick visual reference.

7. Save Tasks:
   After entering a task, click the adjacent save button (with a floppy disk icon) to store your input. The task will be saved and can be retrieved even after refreshing the page.

8. Clear Tasks (Optional):
   If needed, use the "Clear All Tasks" button to remove all saved task inputs. Confirm your decision to clear the tasks.

9. Update Tasks (Optional):
   Modify tasks by clicking on the respective time block, updating the text, and saving the changes. The planner will reflect the most recent edits.

10. Close and Return:
    When finished, close the planner. Your tasks will persist, allowing you to resume planning at a later time. If you reopen the planner, it will display your previously saved tasks.

By following these steps, you can effectively use the planner to organize and manage your daily schedule.
